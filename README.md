<h4><u><b>GIT (GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER):</b></head></u></head></h4>
<body>
        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) commonly used for managing and tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing different versions of files, making it easier to track history, merge changes, and resolve conflicts.
        <b> <u>Key Features of Git:</u></b>
        1.	Distributed Version Control: Unlike centralized version control systems, Git allows every developer to have a complete copy of the entire repository, including the history, on their local machine.
        2.	Branching and Merging: Git makes it easy to create branches, allowing developers to work on different features or fixes independently. Afterward, they can merge changes back into the main branch.
        3.	Commit History: Every change in a Git repository is saved as a "commit," which records a snapshot of the files at that point in time.
        4.	Collaboration: Git supports collaborative workflows through the use of remote repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), where multiple developers can push changes and pull updates.
        5.	Staging Area: Git has a staging area where changes can be reviewed before being committed. This allows users to selectively commit changes.
       <b><u> Basic Git Commands:</u></b>
        •	<b>git init:</b> Initialize a new Git repository.
        •	<b>git clone :</b> Clone an existing repository to your local machine.
        •	<b>git status:</b> View the current status of your working directory and staging area.
        •	<b>git add /Add:</b> Add changes to the staging area before committing.
        •	<b>git commit -m "message": </b>Commit changes with a message.
        •<b>	git push:</b> Push committed changes to a remote repository.
        •	<b>git branch:</b> List or create branches.
        •	<b>git remote add origin main:</b> To link the repository and local file.
        •	<b>git push -u origin main:</b> to push the local file into remote.
    <h4><u>GIT HUB:</u></h4>    
    GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting and managing Git repositories. It provides a web-based interface for users to collaborate on projects, share code, and track version history, making it a popular choice for developers and teams worldwide. GitHub adds features on top of Git to facilitate collaboration, project management, and community engagement.
<b><u>Key Features of GitHub:</u></b>
1.	<b>Repository Hosting:</b> GitHub hosts Git repositories, making it easy to share and collaborate on code. Repositories can be public (open to everyone) or private (restricted access).
2.	<b>Collaboration Tools:</b> GitHub offers a range of tools for collaboration, including:
a.	Pull Requests:Developers can propose changes to a project by submitting a pull request (PR). Other collaborators review the changes before merging them into the main branch.
3.	<b>GitHub Actions:</b> Automate workflows with GitHub Actions, a powerful CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) tool. You can automate testing, building, deployment, and other tasks whenever changes are made to the code.
4.<b>	Documentation:</b> GitHub offers features like README.md files, wikis, and GitHub Pages for hosting project documentation directly from repositories.
5.	<b>Security and Code Scanning:</b> GitHub offers tools like code scanning and secret scanning to help developers find vulnerabilities or potential security issues in their codebase.
6.	<b>GitHub Pages:</b> This feature allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository, making it easy to create personal websites, blogs, or project documentation.
7.	<b>Team and Organization Management:</b> For larger teams and organizations, GitHub provides features like user roles, permissions, and access control to manage team workflows and repositories efficiently.
<h4><u>Full Stack Development:</u></h1>
    Full Stack Development refers to the ability to work on both the front-end and back-end of web applications. A Full Stack Developer is skilled in creating the complete architecture of web applications, handling everything from designing user interfaces (front-end) to managing databases and servers (back-end).
<b>Key technologies for Full Stack Development include:</b>
1.	<b>Front-End Development:</b> Focuses on the client-side, which users interact with directly. Common technologies include:
o	HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling web pages.
o	JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic content.
o	Frameworks/Libraries: Such as React.js, Angular, or Vue.js.
2.	<b>Back-End Development:</b> Focuses on server-side functionality, handling logic, and database interactions. Technologies include:
o	Programming languages like Java, Python, Node.js, or PHP.
o	Frameworks like Spring Boot, Django, or Express.js.
o	Databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
3.	<b>Version Control Systems:</b> Tools like Git to manage and track changes in the codebase.
4.<b>	APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</b> For enabling communication between different parts of the application or with third-party services.
5.	<b>DevOps and Deployment:</b> Knowledge of tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for deploying and maintaining applications.
Full Stack Development allows developers to handle end-to-end workflows, collaborate effectively across teams, and bring projects to completion efficiently. This makes Full Stack Developers highly sought after in the tech industry  .
